                        Fish are aquatic, craniate, gill-bearing animals 
                        that lack limbs with digits. Included in this definition are the 
                        living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various 
                        extinct related groups. Around 99% of living fish species are ray-finned fish, belonging 
                        to the class Actinopterygii, with over 95% belonging to the teleost subgrouping.
