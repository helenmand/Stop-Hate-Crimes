                    Fish are aquatic, craniate, gill-bearing animals 
                    that lack limbs with digits. Included in this definition are the 
                    living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various 
                    extinct related groups. Around 99% of living fish species are ray-finned fish, belonging 
                    to the class Actinopterygii, with over 95% belonging to the teleost subgrouping.
